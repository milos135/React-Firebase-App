React Firebase Protected Routes
This project is a simple React application integrated with Firebase for user authentication and protected routes. It demonstrates how to use Firebase authentication with React to control access to certain pages using protected routes. When a user is logged in, they can access protected content; if not, they are redirected to the login page.

Features
User Authentication: Integrates Firebase authentication (sign-up, login, and logout).
Protected Routes: Uses custom protected route components to restrict access to certain pages.
Firebase Setup: A full setup of Firebase for managing user data and authentication in a React application.
Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Firebase: A platform by Google for building and managing web and mobile applications.
React Router: A library for routing in React applications, used for navigation and protected routes.
CSS: Basic styling for the UI components.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/React-Firebase-ProtectedRoutes.git
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd React-Firebase-ProtectedRoutes
npm install
Set up Firebase:

Create a Firebase project and enable authentication (email/password).
Copy the Firebase configuration and paste it in firebase.js file in your project.
Run the app:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The app will be running at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
